- I have an undergraduate degree in Mathematics (MMath, 2004&ndash;2008)
and a doctoral degree in Engineering Science (DPhil, 2010&ndash;2015).
My [thesis](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:205a18fb-b21f-4148-ba7d-3238f4b1f25b),
supervised by [Antonis Papachristodoulou](https://sysos.eng.ox.ac.uk),
won the 2015 [European PhD Award](https://www.eeci-institute.eu/index.php?p=PhD-Award)
on Control for Complex and Heterogeneous Systems,
awarded by the European Embedded Control Institute (EECI).

- Starting in January 2015, I was a postdoc in Engineering Science at the University of Oxford,
working with [Antonis Papachristodoulou](https://sysos.eng.ox.ac.uk)
on using feedback control to engineer robustness and reduce uncertainty in synthetic biology.

- In mid-2016 I left academic work for the civil service,
joining the Government Operational Research Service.
I enjoyed postings at HMRC
and at UK Research and Innovation
(which was then part of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy).

- In March 2018 I returned to academia.
I began a postdoc with [Ruth Baker](https://www.iamruthbaker.com/)
in the Wolfson Centre for Mathematical Biology at the University of Oxford
where I worked on
[*Next Generation Approaches to Connect Models and Quantitative Data in Biology*](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=BB%2FR000816%2F1).
I moved in June 2021 to the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk)
where I worked in the *AI for Science and Government* research programme
as part of the [Shocks and Resilience](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/shocks-and-resilience) project.

- In June 2022 I once more left academia for a position in Research Engineering at Bentley Systems,
working on pedestrian mobility simulation.
My current job as a Data Scientist at [Datasparq](https://datasparq.ai)
began in September 2023.
