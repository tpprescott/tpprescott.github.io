title: "Observable notebook on optimal cancellations now online!"
---

I have written an Observable notebook to work through the idea that, as well as *pricing* a product, you may also want to *cancel* that product. How do we make the decision to cancel? *When* do we take that decision? How does that depend on the characteristics of the product? 

Take a look at the notebook [here](https://observablehq.com/d/7bc958fb96fa0689) for more details.
