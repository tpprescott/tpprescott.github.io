title: '6th Annual Learning for Dynamics & Control conference @ Oxford'
---

I attended the [L4DC](https://l4dc.web.ox.ac.uk/) conference at Oxford's Maths Institute, where I enjoyed reconnecting with old colleagues and friends from the Oxford Control Group. The topics covered were:

- Foundations of learning of dynamics models
- System identification
- Optimization for machine learning
- Data-driven optimization for dynamical systems
- Distributed learning over distributed systems
- Reinforcement learning for physical systems
- Safe reinforcement learning and safe adaptive control
- Statistical learning for dynamical and control systems
- Bridging model-based and learning-based dynamical and control systems
- Physics-constrained learning
- Physical learning in dynamical and control systems applications in robotics, autonomy, biology, energy systems, transportation systems, cognitive systems, neuroscience, etc.

I went along to the tutorial sessions on 
- Distributionally Robust Optimization for Control
- Learning under Requirements: Supervised and Reinforcement Learning with Constraints
followed by keynotes on
- Representation-based Learning and Control for Dynamical Systems (Na Li, Harvard)
- Learning Enabled Multi-Agent Systems in Societal Systems Transformation (S. Shankar Sastry, UC Berkeley)
- Optogenetic Feedback Control of Gene Expression in Single Cells (Mary Dunlop, Boston U.)
- The state of optimal and learning control in the 2020s (Jonas Buchli, Deepmind)
- Inductive Biases for Robot Reinforcement Learning (Jan Peters, TU Darmstadt)
- Efficient & Realistic Simulation for Autonomous Driving (Shimon Whiteson, Oxford/Waymo)
