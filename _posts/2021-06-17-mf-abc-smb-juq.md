The paper, *Multifidelity approximate Bayesian computation with sequential Monte Carlo parameter sampling*, written
with Prof Ruth Baker, has been
[published](https://doi.org/10.1137/20M1316160)
in the *SIAM/ASA Journal on Uncertainty Quantification*!

**Abstract:**
Multifidelity approximate Bayesian computation ([MF-ABC](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/18M1229742)) is a likelihood-free technique for parameter inference that exploits model approximations to significantly increase the speed of ABC algorithms.
Previous work has considered MF-ABC only in the context of rejection sampling, which does not explore parameter space particularly efficiently.
In this work, we integrate the multifidelity approach with the ABC sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) algorithm into a new MF-ABC-SMC algorithm.
We show that the improvements generated by each of ABC-SMC and MF-ABC to the efficiency of generating Monte Carlo samples and estimates from the ABC posterior are amplified when the two techniques are used together.
