I've written a blog post for Datasparq on how I used optimal control and MPC to design an automated price optimisation algorithm. The solution also made use of layering as optimisation decomposition, a nice callback to reading carried out during my doctoral research over ten years ago!

The post can be found [here](https://www.datasparq.ai/blog/dynamic-pricing-rocket-science).

## Dynamic pricing isn't rocket science… but it can look similar

*How did a Soviet engineer inspire a recent Datasparq dynamic pricing product?*

As dynamic pricers and revenue managers, we might unthinkingly use metaphors like *launching* a product; using deep discounts to *turbo-charge* demand; or we could *apply the brakes* with a price increase. Demand could *drop like a stone*, or maybe it's just undergoing some *turbulence*.

Sometimes, though, it pays to be a literal-minded Data Scientist. Could we double down on this metaphor, and think about how engineering science–*rocket science!*–could apply to the yield management problem?

It turns out that yes, we can, as recent work on an ancillaries pricing product showed us.
