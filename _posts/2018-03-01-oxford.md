I began my PDRA position with [Ruth Baker](http://www.iamruthbaker.com)
in the [Wolfson Centre for Mathematical Biology](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/mathematical-biology),
part of the Mathematical Institute in the University of Oxford.

This position is part of the project
[Next generation approaches to connect models and quantitative data](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=BB%2FR000816%2F1),
led by Ruth and [Michael Stumpf](http://www.theosysbio.bio.ic.ac.uk/people/michael-stumpf/).
