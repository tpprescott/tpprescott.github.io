title: "PPC optimisation via Thompson sampling @ London Bayesian Mixer"
---

[Jordan Palmer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-palmer/), a fellow data scientist at Datasparq,
and I presented our recent work on helping a client optimise their bids to the Google Ads pay per click auction.
The event was the [Bayesian Mixer](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bayesian-mixer/) meetup,
hosted by the Bayes Business School of City University, London.

We talked about how we used [Thompson sampling](https://play-ml.datasparq.ai/article/thompson_sampling)
and constrained convex optimisation to produce bids that optimally balanced uncertainty 
against the objective to maximise paid-for sessions,
all while falling within financial (ROI) constraints.
