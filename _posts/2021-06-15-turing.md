I have begun my new post working as a Senior Research Associate at the 
[Alan Turing Institute](https://turing.ac.uk)!

I will spend the next two years working on causal inference and causal
modelling in complex interconnected systems, as part of the
[Shocks and Resilience](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/shocks-and-resilience)
project, together with 
[Ben MacArthur](http://ben-macarthur.squarespace.com/)
and 
[Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/).
